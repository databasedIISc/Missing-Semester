Databased's _Missing Semester_ is a series of sessions inspired by MIT's original [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu) but with our own flavour, to introduce undergraduate students with basic tools that they must know as developers but which are never covered in traditional coursework.

## Sessions

- DBD001 - Introduction to Linux and Shells
- DBD002 - Introduction to Debuggers and Testing
- DBD003 - Introduction to Git
